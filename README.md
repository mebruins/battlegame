# battlegame
This is my first attempt at a turn-based battle game.
I intend to improve upon it by adding some or all of the following:
  -random damage from each character so the outcome is different every time it is played
  -the option for p.v.p. and p.v.c., another player could play the dragon or character of choice
  -the option for user/player to attack or heal with random damage/health points
  -maybe add more characters
  -add a choice of weapons with varying damage ranges, i.e. wizard could attack with different spells/elf with different weapons, etc.

#battlegame2
  I added the random damage aspect for the dragon, and hopefully correctly for the character.
  
 #battlegame3
  I fixed any random damage aspects for the character.
  I have also added the choice to heal or attack for each turn of the game. Currently, you have an unlimited number of times you can heal. I may add 
  a limit to the number of times you can heal. Seems unfair to the Dragon...
