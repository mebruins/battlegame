# battlegame
This is my first attempt at a turn-based battle game.
I intend to improve upon it by adding some or all of the following:
  -random damage from each character so the outcome is different every time it is played
  -the option for p.v.p. and p.v.c.
  -the option for user/player to attach or heal with random damage/health points
  -maybe add more characters
  -add a choice of weapons with varying damage ranges, i.e. wizard could attack with different spells/elf with different weapons, etc.
